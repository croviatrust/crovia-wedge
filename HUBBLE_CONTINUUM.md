# Hubble Continuum

Hubble is not a compliance product.

It is a public observation continuum for one verifiable condition:

**whether auditable AI training evidence is present — or absent.**

Hubble does not accuse.  
Hubble does not infer intent.  
Hubble does not score compliance.

It records observations over time.

If evidence exists, it can be published.  
If it is absent, that absence becomes observable.

This is not a verdict about anyone.  
It is a record of what was publicly auditable at a given time.

**Crovia does not judge AI systems.  
Crovia records when evidence is missing.  
Repeatedly.**
